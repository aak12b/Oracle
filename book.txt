This is a new paragraph that I'm adding to this file,
dubbed book.txt, as per assignment instructions. To the
best of my knowledge we were supposed to add "a new 
paragraph" to this file, and not knowing exactly what was
expected has led me to write this in the hopes that I'm
either correct or incorrect but witty. Below this I will 
append the result of the git status command.
